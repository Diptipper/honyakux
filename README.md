bite-sized translation practice

A very simple python script that fetches a random sentence from syosetu (you can pick any novels you like). You then try to translate this sentence yourself. When ready, press enter and an LLM will give a translation for you.

Requirements: python (+ the package "requests"), ollama (+ model you want to use such as llama3)
